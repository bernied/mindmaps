# MindMaps

Here are some Mind maps I created using [freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

1. Ad_Ecosystem.mm - A list of companies in display advertising. This is from a few years back.
2. Google_C++_Style_Guide.mm - [Style guidelines](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) for C++ from [google](http://www.google.com) (version 3.199).
3. Logic.mm - Some notes on logic from an online course I took. `Incomplete`
4. R7RS.mm - A work in progress mind map of the [R7RS](http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r8rs.pdf) scheme specification from July 6th 2013 (w/o eratta). `Incomplete`
5. jsp.mm - Some notes on [JSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_structured_programming) and [JSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_system_development).
6. RAFT.mm - RAFT protocol.
These files are in the public domain. Do with them as you will.
